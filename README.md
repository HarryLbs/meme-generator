This app uses new concepts like state, forms, conditional rendering, and side effect.
States is muttable data that you would want to re-render as the data is changed. When the set function for the state is ran, the jsx is rendered again reflecting any data changes.
Forms are input sections on the app that you would want to be added to a database once sumbitted. Using states makes this easy as the values can be saved as the form is being completed through every change.
Side Effects are data sets that are refrenced outside of where the state is initialized(ex. APIs). You would use a react function useEffect to prevent memory leaks by controling when the function is rendered based on a given dependency.
